1.03    2007-12-22  Rhesa Rozendaal <rhesa@cpan.org>
    - updated testî€€01regression in response to test report
      <http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/878852>.
      Thanks!

1.02    2007-12-20  Rhesa Rozendaal <rhesa@cpan.org>
    - updated tests for when DevPopup is present. The interface of
      HTML::Tidy->parse has changed (for the worse, if you ask me) in that
      it returns false both when it fails to call libtidy, and when the document
      has issues.

1.01    2007-12-20  Rhesa Rozendaal <rhesa@cpan.org>
    - updated tests to comply with newer versions of CGI.pm
    - removed $opts{action} ||= 'validate'; I could find no reason why
      it was there in the first place, it seemed to do nothing, and it
      breaks with HTML::Tidy v1.08, which now supports tidy-options as
      a hashref (instead of just a config file).
    - added support for directly supplying tidy-options. This means we
      now require HTML::Tidy v1.08.

1.00    2006-11-20  Rhesa Rozendaal <rhesa@cpan.org>
    - typo fix in pod
      (thanks to Alexander Becker)
    - bumped version to 1.00
    - dist improvements to conform to CPANTS
 
0.51    2006-01-24  Rhesa Rozendaal <rhesa@cpan.org>
    - htmltidy_validate now loads its template by itself to avoid
      problems for people overriding CA::load_tmpl
      (thanks to Alexander Becker)
 
0.50    2005-10-04  Rhesa Rozendaal <rhesa@cpan.org>
    - made htmltidy_validate a report generator for CAP::DevPopup
    - API stable
