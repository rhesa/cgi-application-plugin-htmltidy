CGI-Application-Plugin-HtmlTidy version 0.50
============================================

NAME
    CGI::Application::Plugin::HtmlTidy - Add HTML::Tidy support to
    CGI::Application

SYNOPSIS
    
    use CGI::Application::Plugin::HtmlTidy;

    sub cgiapp_postrun {
        my ($self, $contentref) = @_;

    # your post-process code here

        $self->htmltidy_clean($contentref);
    }


    # generate a validation report
    use CGI::Application::Plugin::DevPopup;
    use CGI::Application::Plugin::HtmlTidy;

CHANGES
This release integrates with CGI::Application::Plugin::DevPopup. If that
plugin is active, this one will add an HTML validation report. As a
consequence, htmltidy_validate() is no longer exported, and should not
be called directly.

DESCRIPTION
This plugin is a wrapper around HTML::Tidy. It exports two methods that
allow you to either validate or clean up the output of your cgiapp
application. They should be called at the end of your postrun method.

The htmltidy_validate method is a helpful addition during development.
It generates a detailed report specifying the issues with your html.

The htmltidy_clean modifies your output to conform to the W3C standards.
It has been in use for quite some time on a largish site (generating
over 100,000 pages per day) and has proven to be quite stable and fast.
Every single page view was valid html, which makes many browsers happy
:-)
